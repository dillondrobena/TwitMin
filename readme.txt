Included is the source code, libraries, and DDL for my dataminer. In order to run it you need to register your app at https://dev.twitter.com/ in order to get the credentials needed to access the API.

Also, must have access to a database, I've been using Oracle DBMS but other solutions may work as well, you may have to edit the Database.java file and possibly change the arguments. I've included the database DDL and the format is very important, so copy it table by table and attribute by attribute

Arguments needed to run (in order):
Database url
Database username
Database password
Twitter consumer key
Twitter consumer secret
Twitter access token
Twitter access token secret
